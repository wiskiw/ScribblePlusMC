# Scribble Plus

**Scribble Plus** is a fork of the original [Scribble](https://github.com/chrrs/scribble) mod by [chrrs](https://github.com/chrrs), maintaining all the beloved features while introducing new enhancements.

## New Features

- **Advanced Cursor Movement**: Experience cursor behavior more akin to standard text editors. This feature is disabled by default, but can be toggled via ModMenu.
- **Undo/Redo Support**: Added support for the `Ctrl+Z` (Undo) and `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Redo) shortcuts. You can undo and redo actions such as *text insertion*, *text deletion*, *style changes*, and *page manipulation*. Please note, this feature is still under testing.
- **Better [Symbol Chat Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/symbol-chat) Integration**: Improved integration with the Symbol Chat mod ensures that various fonts and symbols are displayed correctly, providing a seamless chat experience.


## Original Features

- **Easy Text Formatting**: Add colors, bold, italics, underline, and more to your book text effortlessly - no need to mess with the '§' symbol or remember to reset colors.
- **Page Management**: Insert or remove pages at any point using additional buttons below the page. No more shuffling around with copy-pasting pages.
- **Book Saving**: Save your books to your hard drive to ensure the contents are always recoverable. This feature also allows for easy copying of content from one book to another.
- **Edit Existing Colors**: Edit books with existing color codes effortlessly. Scribble+ recognizes existing codes and lets you modify them with ease.
- **Progress Protection**: Before closing a book without saving, Scribble+ will ask if you're sure, preventing accidental loss of progress.

Scribble Plus  will strive to keep up with updates to the original Scribble mod, ensuring that any new features, bug fixes, or improvements are integrated into Scribble Plus whenever possible.
